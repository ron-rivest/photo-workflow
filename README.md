Notes on photography workflow for serious non-professionals

by Alex Rivest and Ronald L. Rivest

This repository contains notes on managing the "workflow" associated
with serious (but non-professional) photographers.  We suggest answers
to questions such as:
    -- working with file systems (naming of files and directories)
    -- working with backups
    -- editing your photos
    -- moving files between devices (camera, iPhone, laptop)
    
The notes are not intended to be comprehensive, but only to provide
"one way" of doing things.  The suggestions made here may rapidly become
obsolete, as in this area technology is changing rapidly.
